  ## Installation
In a command-line application, the user is prompted to enter up to three characters.

The user is then asked to enter the desired text color, which can be done either by using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

Then, the user is prompted to choose a shape from a list consisting of circle, triangle, and square.

After selecting a shape, the user is asked to specify its color, once again using either a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

Once the user has completed all the prompts, an SVG file named "logo.svg" is created, and the message "Generated logo.svg" is displayed in the command line.
