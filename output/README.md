  ## Description
  In a command-line application where users enter input, they are given the opportunity to input up to three characters.

Similarly, when users are prompted to specify the text color, they can enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

When users are asked for the desired shape, they are presented with options to choose from, such as circle, triangle, and square.

To specify the color of the chosen shape, users can enter a color keyword and a hexadecimal number.

After users have provided input for all the prompts, the application generates an SVG file named "logo.svg" and displays the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.

To view the resulting logo, users can simply open the logo.svg file in a browser, where they will see an image sized at 300x200 pixels that meets their specified criteria.
